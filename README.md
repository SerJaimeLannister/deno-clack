This is an experimental clack alternative (hopefully going to try to add it to be 1:1) and add more features 

Please Star this repo! It would mean the world to me

Also A Gif speaks more than a 1000's word of readme , here is what currently deno-clack is , I am going to slowly add more features (currently only has prompt)
